**Wordle Puzzle Challenge**
The rules of Wordle are simple: A player has SIX tries to guess a 5-letter word that has been selected at random from a list of possible words. Guesses need to be valid 5-letter words. After each guess, a player receives feedback about how close their guess was to the word, which provides information they can use to try to solve the puzzle. This feedback lets you know whether each letter your guess is either [1] in the solution word and in the correct spot, [2] in the solution word but in the wrong position, or [3] not in the solution word. In app/browser versions of Wordle, this feedback is provided visually using colors, but that need not be the case.

This week’s programming exercise is to work with a partner to get as far along as you can writing R code that allows you to play Wordle to your heart’s content using R/RStudio!

The assignment and steps below were inspired by this fun blog post… but before you reference it or other online sites, try to tackle this coding exercise on your own.
